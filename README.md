## Weather App 2.0
<ul>
<li>This is an application that shows weather conditions for one's current location for upto 6 days.</li>
<li>It is responsive which means it can be used on any device.</li>
<li>The default location is Nairobi</li>
</ul>

### Frameworks used:
<div>
  <img align="top" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB" />
  <img align="top" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/vite-%23646CFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white" />
  <img align="top" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white" />
</div>

### What I learnt:
<ul>
  <li>I was able to create my own context hook which returns the location of the user.</li>
  <li>Using TailwindCSS, I added some animations to the  application.</li>
</ul>
 
### Challenges:
<p>I was not able to add the world map so that the user can check the weather at any specific location, but its a feature that will be implemented in the future.</p>
